When I looked at the course description and what would be taught there were so many topics that I had heard about because they’re used in the fields I’m studying (statistics and computer science), but I knew I wasn’t going to get much instruction on them through my classes. So I’m expecting this class to fill in some gaps that would otherwise still be empty by the time I graduate.
